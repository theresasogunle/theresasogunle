### About Me
With over 7 years of experience building web applications across fintech, ecommerce, and entertainment, I specialize in designing and architecting scalable systems that serve millions of users. My career spans hands-on frontend and backend development to leading architectural decisions at scale.


I started as a software engineer intern and instructor at Aptech, where I taught C and Java while building foundational engineering practices. This evolved into high impact product work at Eyowo (fintech), where I architected the frontend application powering millions of users sending money via phone number. I built a payment checkout modal that handled massive scale.
I have also contributed to premium digital experiences through an agency partnership, including Red Bulletin's magazine style redesign and Disney's "Reimagine Tomorrow Together" campaign website.


Most recently, my focus has shifted from individual IC contributions to architectural leadership. At Modus Create, I drive microservices and microfrontends strategy for enterprise clients including Contabo and ScienceLogic. At Contabo, I architect both frontend and backend solutions on the platform development team. At ScienceLogic, I led the Billing and Telemetry Fullstack team building data ingestion and processing pipelines that handle network device metrics, enabling operational insights across their enterprise monitoring platform. My work balances technical depth with leadership, driving architectural decisions that enable teams to ship quality work at scale.

In my free time, I love writing technical articles. Checkout my profile on [Medium](https://medium.com/@sogunledolapo)
